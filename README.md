# MyPL

This is a programming language.

## Q&A

### But *why?*

Why not?

In all seriousness now, I really like the idea of creating a programming
language from scratch. Philosophically, I think it is kind of beautiful how a
full-fledged programming language can be expressed in terms of another
programming language alone. This also speaks closely to the principle of
turing-completeness, which I find quite interesting.

Additionally, I think it's a very rich experience programming-wise, since
creating a compiler is quite a challenging task, and involves so many concepts.

Also, who never wanted to say "I made a programming language"?


### Does this language work?

Probably, yeah; hope so at least. I'll do my best.


### Is it useful, though?

Nah, I don't think so. At least not if you're talking about using it on a
product or anything even remotely related.

As an instructional reference, on the other hand, I think this might be of use
if you're interested in understanding the inner workings of a compiler.

I mean, sure, you could just look at Ruby's of Python's source code, but (and I
speak from experience) this will most likely only serve as a major source of
frustration. That's because those languages were made to be *used*, and tend to
prioritize having crazy efficiency, or extensibility, or cute syntax that is
just hellish to parse (I'm looking at you Ruby).

But not MyPL. This language prioritizes *you*, my fellow programmer, and your
well being while reading the code and trying to figure out how each piece fits
in on the bigger picture. Feel honored.
