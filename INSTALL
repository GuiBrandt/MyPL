Everybody knows compiling C projects is a huge pain, and this project is not an
exception. On the other hand, I can't make it too complicated or I might become
unable to compile it myself, so I'll try to keep it to a minimum.

All you should need is:

    autoconf
    automake
    make install

Honestly, it would be crazy if it worked first-try.
Good luck fellow soldier.
